##Using regression models to predict the sales of food products 

- **Author:** Erica Kitano



### Business problem:
Help the retailer understand the properties of products and outlets that play crucial roles in increasing sales.

### Data:
The original source of the data used is `Big Mart Sales Prediction` from [this link](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/).

### Methods
- Data cleaning such as checking for duplicates, filling in missing values, fixing inconsistent values
- Perform Exploratory Analysis to understand the statistics and correlation of each feature to the target

### Results

(plots)

### Model
- Decision Tree Model (TBD)

- Evaluation using Metrics

- Analysis: Based on the metrics, the Optimized Decision Tree Model has the lowest MAE of 738 and RMSE of 1057. The difference between RMSE and MAE implies that the model is making some larger errors as well.

Since the average value of Item_Outlet_Sales column is 2181 and the Mean Average Error on the Test data is about 738 for the optimized Decision Tree Regression model, the model is off by about 33.8 % on average. (TBD)
